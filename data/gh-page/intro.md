# What's Lofe

**Lofe** is a [quine app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)), ie. a way to store data in a html file, by downloading an empty version, open it in a browser, modify it, save it (by downloading the new version with the modifications you made), and do it again. **Lofe** is an alternative to [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) and [Feather Wiki](https://feather.wiki/), but closer to the latter, with some specific goals:

* small footprint: a Lofe file will weight under 150 kB
* module centric: in Lofe everything is a module, even the core can be easily change
* developer oriented: the repository contains all the tools to create a customized Lofe version
